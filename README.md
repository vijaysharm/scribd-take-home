# Scribd Take-home Test

This project contains the Top Charts view from the Everands iOS app. The page is implemented using SwiftUI using Xcode 15.4 with a minimum iOS target os 17.5

The data for the application is taken from the [everand website](https://www.everand.com/) on July 13, 2024. The data is contained in a json file named media.json in the project folder.

The project loads the data from the local file. The project also embeds the cover page of the media in the assets. You will notice that the json data has an image property which points to the name of the image in the assets. I did not use a URL because I couldn't find a freely available service that hosts the reqquired image.
